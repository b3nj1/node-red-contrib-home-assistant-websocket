# JSONata

There are three functions added for JSONata expressions within the Home Assistant nodes.

- `$entity()` returns the entity that triggered the node
- `$prevEntity()` returns the previous state entity if the node is an event node
- `$entities()` returns all entities in the cache
- `$entities(entity_id)` returns a single entity from cache matching passed in entity_id

When JSONata appears in the conditional dropdown it expects the expression to return a boolean, true or false.

When it is chosen with a conditional, not JSONata it will return a value of the evaluated expression that will be checked against the conditional chosen.
